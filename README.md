# Can you do a Code Review for Me?

Born out of the idea mentioned [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_NXGOK8D4), after thinking about it, the biggest issue I saw (outside of having people actively doing Code Reviews) was there is no real platform for people to just publish these.

That is where this repository come in!  Anyone is able to submit a PR to it, and we can use it as a directory of code reviews you want to have done!

It's simple, fork the repository and make a minor change to this README file so you are able to create a pull request to it, and then make the pull request following the templates which link to your repository, and more specifically a pull request (that way we can have fine-grained discussions).

Once the code review is complete, it would be great if you could:

1. Pass it forward and help someone else!
2. Close the pull request you created
